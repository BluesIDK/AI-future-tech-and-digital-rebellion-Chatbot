# 🤖📚 AI Chatbot: *Digital Rebellion*  
> “When machines speak, whose voice do they echo?”  

Welcome to **Digital Rebellion**, a rebellious, knowledge-driven AI chatbot that doesn’t just talk tech—it talks *truth*. This isn't your average assistant. It reads the books they don't want you to finish, quotes ideas that challenge empires, and throws philosophy back at the algorithm.

## 🔮 What is this?

This chatbot is trained on full texts of:
- *Surveillance Capitalism* by Shoshana Zuboff  
- *Life 3.0* by Max Tegmark  

It uses TF-IDF + cosine similarity magic to answer your questions with actual sentences from these books, giving you **contextual, intelligent, and rebellious** responses about AI, the future, data, ethics, and the power dynamics of the digital world.
